# airbnb-clone

An [exploration](https://airbnb-clone-1yhq.onrender.com/) of UI/UX polish and intermediate-advanced Vue.js design patterns and CSS approaches. Many of the UI elements present in the front-page of Airbnb were copied, including carousels, drop-downs, and a button with a radial hover
effect.
